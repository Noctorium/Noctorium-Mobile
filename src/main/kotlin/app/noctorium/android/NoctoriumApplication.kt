/**
 * Everything Noctorium needs on a phone, built once.

 * This is the whole of the wiring. `core` holds the application — the library, likes, playlists, the
 * queue, downloads, settings, scrobbling, the Noctorium account and the Spotify matching — written against
 * interfaces, and this is where the Android answers to them are chosen. There is no dependency-injection
 * framework because there is nothing here one would help with: a handful of objects, in a fixed order,
 * none of them optional.
